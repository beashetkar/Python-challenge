# Python-challenge

Python scripting skills. For Python challenges, we must choose 2 of 4 of the following options:

* PyBank
* PyPoll
* PyBoss
* PyParagraph

### PyBank: Analyzing the financial records of a given company. 

- Datasets: budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll: Analyze the votes of a small, rurarl town and help with the cunting process.

- Datasetes: election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv.

The task is to analyze the votes and give the following information:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

### PyBoss: Modify the format of the recoremployee_data1ds.

- Datasets: employee_data1.csv and employee_data2.csv

Convert and export the data to use the following format:

Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA

In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

* The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
* The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.
* The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
* The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

### PyParagraph: Getting to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy.
Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:


Datasets: paragraph_1.txt and paragraph_2.txt

Assess the passage for each of the following:

* Approximate word count
* Approximate sentence count
* Approximate letter count (per word)
* Average sentence length (in words)
